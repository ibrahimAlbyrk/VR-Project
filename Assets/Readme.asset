    text: Press the grab button on the bow with one hand and then use your other
      hand to reach for the quiver on your shoulder, you will feel a small haptic
      indicating that your hand is within range of the arrow. Once you feel the haptic
      feedback, press and hold the grab button to select the arrow and then move
      it towards the bow string. Now all you need to do is pulll the arrow and release
      the grab button to release the arrow.
